Hello everyone!!

This is a Project on Fake News Detection using Machine Learning. 

The workflow is simple, using an Algorithm we feed a line into the html code. The Algorithm takes the code from HTML using Python and based on its training and testing , it predicts the output and sends the output to the result html file which shows us the output in our browser. 

Flask Framework helps communication between Python and HTML files.

Try to use latest dataset for better feel!!

Enjoy :)
